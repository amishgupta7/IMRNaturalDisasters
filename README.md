# I am Ready: Natural Disaster (2023)
**Award:** 2nd Place, Congressional App Challenge

## Project Overview
Inspired by the devastating global climate crises of 2023—including the Lahaina wildfires and Hurricane Idalia—this app was developed to bridge the gap between fear and preparedness. It serves as a centralized hub for disaster education and real-time tracking, empowering users to take agency and stay safe during the immediate aftermath of catastrophic events.

## Key Functionalities
* **Dynamic Safety Plan:** Actionable checklists for "Before" (Go-Bags, defensible space) and "After" (reconnecting, damage assessment) phases of a disaster.
* **Real-Time Disaster Mapper:** Integrated tracking for ongoing wildfires, hurricanes, and floods to assist in evacuation and safety planning.
* **Interactive Awareness Quiz:** Gamified learning modules designed to reinforce critical survival knowledge with immediate pedagogical feedback.
* **Historical Knowledge Hub:** Data-driven insights into historically significant disasters to help users understand potential scales of impact.

## Technical Evolution
* **Cross-Platform Learning:** Successfully transitioned from a Python-based data background to mobile development by self-teaching **Swift and Xcode** in one month.
* **Scalable Software Architecture:** Optimized the codebase from 36 potential screens down to 6 core adaptive screens. This ensures the app remains lightweight and high-performance, which is critical in low-bandwidth disaster scenarios.

## Responsible Design & Safety Steps
Recognizing that people might use this app in real emergencies, I included these features to keep users safe:
* **Using Official Info:** I made sure all safety advice comes from actual government and emergency guides so people don't get the wrong idea.
* **Official Sources First:** The app reminds users to listen to local news and police/fire departments first before checking the app.
* **Offline Access:** I designed the "Go-Bag" lists to work even without Wi-Fi or data, because cell towers often go down during big storms.
