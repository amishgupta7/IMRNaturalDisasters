# I am Ready: Natural Disaster (2023)
**Award:** 2nd Place, Congressional App Challenge

## Project Overview
Inspired by the devastating global climate crises of 2023—including the Lahaina wildfires and Hurricane Idalia—this app was developed to bridge the gap between fear and preparedness. It serves as a centralized hub for disaster education and real-time tracking, empowering users to take agency and stay safe during the immediate aftermath of catastrophic events.

## Key Features
* **Dynamic Safety Plan:** Actionable checklists for "Before" (Go-Bags, defensible space) and "After" (reconnecting, damage assessment) phases of a disaster.
* **Real-Time Disaster Mapper:** Integrated tracking for ongoing wildfires, hurricanes, and floods to assist in evacuation and safety planning.
* **Interactive Awareness Quiz:** Gamified learning modules designed to reinforce critical survival knowledge with immediate pedagogical feedback.
* **Historical Knowledge Hub:** Data-driven insights into historically significant disasters to help users understand potential scales of impact.

## Technical Evolution
* **Cross-Platform Learning:** Successfully transitioned from a Python-based data background to mobile development by self-teaching **Swift and Xcode** in one month.
* **Scalable Software Architecture:** Optimized the codebase from 36 potential screens down to **6 core adaptive screens**. This ensures the app remains lightweight and high-performance, which is critical in low-bandwidth disaster scenarios.

## Ethical Guardrails & Risk Mitigation
Recognizing the high stakes of disaster response, I implemented specific safeguards to ensure user safety:
* **Data Integrity:** All safety advice is curated from official government and emergency guidelines to prevent the spread of misinformation.
* **Primary Source Emphasis:** The interface explicitly directs users to prioritize local emergency broadcasts and official authorities over app data during active events.
* **Offline Functionality:** Core safety checklists and "Go-Bag" guides are designed to be accessible without cellular data, acknowledging that infrastructure often fails during crises.
